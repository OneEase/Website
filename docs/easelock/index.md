# EaseLock 

Create a custom smart lock device for your existing door that integrates an Atmega328 microcontroller,
HC-05 Bluetooth module, and relay module, enabling remote operation from any paired Android device.

In this project, I will show you how to build a comprehensive prototype of smart lock step by step 
with minimal cost.

My initial intent with this tutorial was to show you that you can make build this project even if you
have little experience with all of the various parts (AVR chips, Bluetooth, Android).  I still
believe you can if you follow the steps in this tutorial.

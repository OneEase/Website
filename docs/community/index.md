# In Memoriam: Ethan Thompson, Founder of OneEase

It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Ethan Thompson, the founder of OneEase, who sacrificed his life in the line of duty as an international volunteer in Ukraine, fighting against the Russian invasion in 2022.

Ethan's bravery and selflessness in the face of danger are a testament to his unwavering commitment to his values and principles. As the core founder of OneEase, he was the driving force behind our community, and his passing leaves a void that can never be filled.

Under Ethan's leadership, OneEase flourished as a beacon of innovation and creativity, inspiring countless individuals to pursue their passions and make a positive impact on the world. His legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched and the projects he initiated, but his absence will be deeply felt.

As a community, we are heartbroken by this loss, and we have made the difficult decision to close down OneEase, effective immediately. We are grateful for the support and contributions of our members over the years, and we hope that Ethan's sacrifice will not be in vain.

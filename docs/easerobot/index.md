# EaseRobot - A Cutting-Edge Autonomous Robot

Welcome to EaseRobot, a cutting-edge autonomous robot designed to revolutionize home automation.
This innovative DIY robotics project aims to create a sophisticated house-bot that can navigate and
interact with its environment. In this series, we'll delve into the project's details, starting with
the concept, hardware selection, and initial software development.

Inspired by the possibilities of modern robotics, EaseRobot is built around a Raspberry Pi 3, Model
B, leveraging its processing power and versatility. By harnessing the capabilities of the Robot
Operating System (ROS) and Raspberry Pi, we can focus on developing the robot's features rather than
building a custom processor board from scratch.

EaseRobot is designed to perform various tasks, including facial recognition, speech synthesis, and
autonomous locomotion. Our robot will be equipped with a 7" touchscreen display and a camera module,
enabling it to interact with users and navigate its surroundings. With ROS, we can develop and test
nodes for the system, simulate the robot's behavior, and refine our code.

In this project, we'll explore various "missions" that EaseRobot can perform, starting with the
ability to take messages to specific individuals. We'll break down this mission into smaller design
goals, including face recognition, speech synthesis, locomotion control, and navigation. Join us on
this exciting journey as we bring EaseRobot to life and explore the possibilities of autonomous
robotics.
